# Assets / Refresh

Refreshes the AssetDatabase. Use it if any file was added or updated in the project outside of Unity API. Use it if need to force scripts recompilation when '.cs' file changed.

## Inputs

- `options` — `ImportAssetOptions` flag (default `ForceSynchronousImport`).
- `requestId` — required for processing-mode responses; the tool returns `Processing` immediately and delivers a follow-up completion when compilation finishes.

## Behavior

Runs `AssetDatabase.Refresh(options)`. If `EditorApplication.isCompiling` is true after the refresh, schedules a post-compilation notification and returns a `Processing` response. If compilation already failed (`EditorUtility.scriptCompilationFailed`), returns `Success` with the compilation error details. Otherwise returns a plain `Success`.

## How to Call

Call this tool through the MCP client connected to the local Matrix Bridge server.

Example input:
```json
{
  "options": {}
}
```

> For complex input, keep the payload as valid JSON and send it through your connected MCP client.

Read the /feeder-mcp-initial-setup skill for local connection setup.
